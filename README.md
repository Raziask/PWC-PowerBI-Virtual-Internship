Background

This project is part of the PwC Switzerland Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience, demonstrating the application of digital tools in data visualization, automation, data cleansing, and more to address common business challenges. It features a series of Power BI dashboards focusing on Call Centre Trends, Customer Retention, and Diversity & Inclusion. Each dashboard provides actionable insights into different facets of business operations and strategic planning, aiding PwC Switzerland and its clients in enhancing operational efficiency, fostering customer loyalty, and promoting a more inclusive workplace.

Through meticulous data analysis and visualization, this project aims to support informed decision-making and highlight areas for improvement and innovation.



 

My Role: Completed a job simulation where I strengthened my PowerBI skills to better understand clients and their data visualisation needs.
Demonstrated expertise in data visualization through the creation of Power BI dashboards that effectively conveyed KPIs, showcasing the ability to respond to client requests with well-designed solutions.
Leveraged analytical problem-solving skills to examine HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs, and identified root causes for gender balance issues at the executive management level, highlighting a commitment to data-driven decision-making.
 

To do this, I will follow the six steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze and Share, and Act. SQL Queries Used in perform the above steps:


ASK
Task2---- Call Centre Trends
•	Overall customer satisfaction
•	Overall calls answered/abandoned
•	Calls by time
•	Average speed of answer
•	Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

Task3----Customer Retention


1.	Define proper KPIs
2.	Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
3.	Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed



Task4_Diversity & Inclusion

1.	Define relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and create a visualisation
2.	Write what you think some root causes of their slow progress

   Prepare

   The .pbix files associated with each dashboard are hosted within this repository. After installing Power BI Desktop, download the .pbix files from the repository and open them with Power BI Desktop. The data sources are embedded within the files, eliminating the need for additional setup to explore the visualizations. Users can navigate through the dashboards using the tabs at the bottom of the Power BI interface to explore different visualizations and insights.

To download the .pbix files, navigate to the folder in this repository where they are stored, select a file, and use the 'Download' button. Cloning or downloading the entire repository is an alternative method for accessing all files.
